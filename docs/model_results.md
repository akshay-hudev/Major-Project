# Model Results

This page records the latest full MIMIC-IV Colab result reported from the GPU
run on the generated `(sequence_length=6, features=59)` arrays.

## Dataset Used

| Split | Samples | Positives | Positive Rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Train | 24,678 | 4,178 | 16.93% |
| Validation | 5,289 | 896 | 16.94% |
| Test | 5,289 | 896 | 16.94% |

The first training attempt produced `NaN` losses because the saved `X_*.npy`
arrays still contained missing values after preprocessing and scaling:

| Split | NaN Values Replaced | Infinite Values |
|---|---:|---:|
| Train | 296,136 | 0 |
| Validation | 63,468 | 0 |
| Test | 63,468 | 0 |

The existing arrays were sanitized by replacing non-finite feature values with
zero before restarting training. After that repair, the LSTM/BiLSTM attention
model trained normally.

## Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | AUC-ROC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| BiLSTM Attention | 0.8134 | 0.4712 | 0.8304 | 0.6012 | 0.9021 |
| BiGRU | 0.8132 | 0.4712 | 0.8404 | 0.6038 | 0.9076 |
| Transformer Encoder Classifier | 0.8198 | 0.4814 | 0.8237 | 0.6077 | 0.9096 |

The Transformer Encoder Classifier has the best AUC-ROC, F1 score, precision,
and accuracy in this run. The BiGRU has the highest recall, so it catches the
largest fraction of worsening cases at the default threshold.

## Transformer Encoder Classifier Result

This is a Transformer encoder classifier, not a decoder-only Transformer and
not a language model. It projects each 59-feature timestep into a `d_model=128`
embedding, prepends a learnable classification token, adds positional encoding,
then applies a 3-layer multi-head self-attention encoder.

## Why These Results Improved

The first run was not valid because `NaN` feature values caused `NaN` losses.
The apparent 83% validation accuracy in that failed run was just the model
predicting the majority stable/improving class. Since only about 16.9% of
samples are worsening, a model can look accurate while missing nearly all
worsening cases.

After sanitization, training became meaningful. The strong AUC-ROC of `0.9021`
shows that the model ranks worsening cases well across thresholds. The recall
of `0.8304` means it identified most worsening cases on the test set. Precision
is lower at `0.4712` because the default `0.5` threshold produces false
positives, which is common when optimizing for high recall on an imbalanced
clinical task.

## Methods That Produced The Result

The results came from these methods:

- A cardiac MIMIC-IV cohort selected from diagnosis codes.
- ICU/admission timelines converted into fixed-length sequences of 6 visits.
- A 59-feature representation containing vitals, cardiac labs, renal/metabolic
  labs, CBC features, clinical context, and temporal gaps.
- A Cardiac Severity Index based label that separates worsening progression
  from stable or improving progression.
- Feature imputation, standardization, and post-scaling finite-value
  sanitization.
- A 2-layer bidirectional LSTM encoder with attention pooling over timesteps.
- A 2-layer bidirectional GRU recurrent baseline.
- A Transformer Encoder Classifier with a CLS token, sinusoidal positional
  encoding, and multi-head self-attention over patient visits.
- Weighted `BCEWithLogitsLoss` to handle the 16.9% positive-class imbalance.
- AdamW optimization, dropout, gradient clipping, validation-loss checkpointing,
  and early stopping.

The most important interpretation is that the model traded some accuracy and
precision for much better worsening-case recall. For this task, AUC-ROC, recall,
and F1 are more informative than accuracy alone.
